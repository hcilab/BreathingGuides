# Paced Breathing Guide

A simple breath pacing stimulus that help users sustain a consistent breathing rate during paced breathing exercises. Circular stimulus both changes in size (grows and shrinks) and opacity (becomes darker and lighter) to guide breathing.


# Launching the Application

Lauch the main application from the Processing 3.0 editor. Desired breathing rate (CPM - cycles per minute) and breathing depth (depth) can be adjusted using the sliders at the top of the program window.


# Coaching Instuctions

Align your breathing with pacer such that you inhale as the circle grows and becomes darker, and exhale as the circle shrinks and becomes lighter. If it helps, imagine that the circle depicts your abdomen extending and contracting with each cycle of breath.
